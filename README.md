# PokéHoum

This project was a test made as part of the recruitment process for the company [Houm](https://houm.com). The job application was for the frontend part of a project, so they required me to develop a small marketplace-like view using a public API. The API chosen (well, given as example and I took it) was the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), which retrieves a lot of detailed data about every existing pokemon.

My focus on this was to showcase my frontend design skills, some CSS tricks and whatnot, so it is not really that useful or impressive functionality-wise, but it looks pretty I guess (?). All styles and components are \[almost\] completely custom-made. It does have the entire Bootstrap library installed just to use the text fields, woops.

### The project is live on https://scisneros.github.io/houm_test/

## Installation

It's a simple React project made with `create-react-app`, so you just do that `yarn install` thing then `yarn start` or something like that idk.
